# IAMX DID Specification Draft v0.1

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID IAMX for hosting DIDs on the Cardano blockchain, also referred to as IAMX DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

# 1. Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

# 2. IAMX DID Syntax

IAMX DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

IAMX DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

IAMX LEDGER is a alphanumeric string

IAMX UID (specific-idstring) is conform to [IETF RFC 4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)

The ABNF grammar used to generate the IAMX DID identifier is as follows:

```
iamx-did = did:iamx: ledger : specific-idstring
ledger = ledger identifyer
specific-idstring = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

```

`did:iamx:cardano:` denotes that IAMX DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are registered on the Cardano blockchain.

Below is an example of a IAMX DID:

```

did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453

```

## 2.2 IAMX DID Registration and Deactivation

iamx DID can be automatically generated without registration for each Cardano address.

When a IAMX DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the IAMX DID identifier will remain on the Cardano blockchain.

A deactivated IAMX DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## 2.3 IAMX DID Document

Each IAMX DID will have a corresponding IAMX DID Document, which is a set of data describing this IAMX DID.

Below is the basic structure of the IAMX DID Document:

```json
{
  "context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453",
  "authentication": {
    "id": "",
    "type": "",
    "controller": "",
    "publicKeyMultibase": ""
  },
  "credentials": []
}
```

# 3. Context

iamx DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"]
}
```

## 3.1 Identifiers

iamx DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the IAMX DID subject that the IAMX DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid IAMX DID. A IAMX DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453"
}
```

# 3.2 Public Keys

A IAMX DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that IAMX DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of IAMX DIDs. A IAMX DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple IAMX DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller` and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. IAMX DID Documents support `BIP32-Ed25519`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid IAMX DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this IAMX DID.

The encoding formats that IAMX DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `AdaAddress`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
    {
      "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453#keys-1",
      "type": "BIP32-Ed25519",
      "controller": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453",
      "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
    },
    {
      "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453#keys-1",
      "type": "BIP32-Ed25519",
      "controller": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453",
      "AdaAddress": "addr1qxjq9aj8hy29jkp9dxeepe88ksayl4kqw7qe8et33j6ucxmj2ldj3f0f2l3xrk8ep7hwvde3wa8l9w4wkp8wxfshta2sya6pxt"
    }
  ]
}
```

# 3.4 Authentication

iamx DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification miamxds.

A IAMX DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding IAMX DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification miamxds for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification miamxds. Each verification miamxd in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453#keys-2",
	  "type": "BIP32-Ed25519",
	  "controller": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453",
	  "publicKeyHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a IAMX DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A IAMX DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct IAMX DIDs.

A IAMX DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification miamxd into the `authentication` property of the delegated IAMX DID.

It is worth noting that a IAMX DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The IAMX DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:iamx:cardano:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:iamx:cardano:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453",
  "controller": [
	  "did:iamx:cardano:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	  "did:iamx:cardano:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

# 3.5 Service Information

iamx DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

iamx DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular IAMX DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:iamx:cardano:d36d6f76-e463-4e48-a97e-908edaee6453#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

# 3.6 Created

iamx DID Documents do not include a `created` property as IAMX DID can be automatically generated for each Cardano address.

# 3.7 Updated

iamx DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

# 4. Security Considerations

The security depends on two key aspects:

- Ledger security modell
- Integration of IAMX into ledger modell.

## 4.1. Ledger security modell

IAMX decided to use Cardano as the initial Public ledger. The Cardano security is based on the Ouroboros protocoll. Ouroboros features mathematically verifiable security against attackers. Security properties for the protocol are comparable to those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. For more Details on the protocoll can be found in the whitepaper:  
https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf

## 4.2. IAMX application

DIDs will be written into the ledger either via a cardano node. Eiher via a cardano full node operated by the user or via an API Call to the IAMX Backend.

The IAMX DID documents will never conatain any Private information in clear text. All information is hashed and encrypted based on PKS cryptography in order to avoid potential breach of private Data. The Data Sets a encrypetd at least by the Holder and the issuer.

Even if the the private keys get compromised the all information the atakcer might obtain is the hash of the attributes.

- As all Datasets will be Salted per User and per Credential.
- There will never be an Dataset which conistst of only one Attributem which makes a rainbow attack even more unlikely.

In combination even if the cryptography fails or is compromised obtaining the data from the hash is practically impossible.

# 5. Privacy Considerations

Data security depends on two key factors:

-
- Data stored on the ledger

in the achtitecture of the underlyig ledger used to store the data. The first implementation of the IAMX will happen on the cardano

In a public EOSIO network, all communication is visible by watching the blockchain. In a private network both the peer-to-peer and the node to client communication should be encrypted to ensure data surveillance protection.

# 4. Appendix
